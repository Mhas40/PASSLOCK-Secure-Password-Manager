## 📘 Project Description

**Passlock** is a secure, intelligent, and modern password management application designed to help users protect and manage their digital identities efficiently. Built using the powerful **Next.js framework**, **TypeScript**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI**, Passlock delivers a seamless and responsive user experience across devices.

The system integrates **AI-powered features** via **Google's Genkit**, offering functionalities beyond traditional password managers. These include strong password generation, real-time password strength assessment, and security score evaluation—providing users with actionable recommendations to improve their digital hygiene.

Key features include:
- 🔐 **Secure Credential Vault:** Store, categorize, and manage passwords under personalized tags (Work, Social, Finance, etc.).
- 🧠 **AI-Based Password Generator:** Customize password length and complexity, and assess strength before saving.
- 📊 **AI Security Reports:** Receive a detailed overview of password strength, reuse patterns, entropy, and personalized tips.
- 👥 **User Authentication:** Register and log in using hashed credentials with strong password enforcement.
- ⚙️ **Modern Frontend Architecture:** Modular and scalable design using Next.js App Router, React components, and local storage for prototype data handling.

Although the current prototype uses **local storage** for ease of deployment and offline use, the architecture is ready for future upgrades including **secure cloud-based storage**, **2FA integration**, and **browser extensions**.

**Passlock** reimagines password management as an intelligent, proactive security assistant rather than just a digital locker, making it a forward-thinking solution in the realm of personal cybersecurity.
